# Student Evaluation of Teaching Using Sentiment Analysis

The goal of this project is to develop a robust automated feedback analysis system that will allow users to write feedback for their department and teacher. The system will process and extract the data using NLTK, and then apply sentiment analysis using various machine learning algorithms. The best algorithm will be selected to extract the opinions and subjectivity from the student feedback, which will then be classified into three different categories: positive, negative, and neutral.
